# Spotify Music Refresher

Is this you?

"I wish I always had a fresh set of music to listen to on Spotify."

Then this project might help you! I am always finding myself refreshing four main playlists on Spotify:

- Latest Liked: 100 most recent songs I have liked. DONE
- Random Liked: 100 random songs from my liked songs. DONE
- New Albums: Add all new albums from the artists I have liked Done
- Top Songs: A single playlist containing the most popular songs from the most popular playlists (e.g. Top Songs - Global, Top Songs Mexico, Hits de Internet, big on the internet, etc.). DONE
